!!! tip
    To benefit from all of the [features] offered by Read the Docs, you will need
    to use the [Read the Docs theme][theme] which ships with MkDocs. The various
    themes which may be referenced in Read the Docs' documentation are Sphinx
    specific themes and will not work with MkDocs.
